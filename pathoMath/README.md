# pathoMath ðŸ’¡ðŸ§¬

Welcome to **pathoMath** â€” a student-led initiative using math and computational biology to model and understand rare congenital diseases.

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sharanya Roy, a high school student passionate about pediatric medicine, competitive math, and computational biology.

## ðŸŒŸ Current Focus: Tay-Sachs Disease
We're exploring:
- How genetic mutations affect enzyme production
- Modeling the breakdown of GM2 gangliosides in neurons
- Simulating how treatments could potentially slow disease progression

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `models/`: Core disease modeling scripts
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for visual simulations
- `data/`: Open-source biological datasets

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rareRithm.git
cd rareRithm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

âœ¨ Letâ€™s use math to heal the world â€” one rare disease at a time.
